Data source contain customers behavior of customers such as demographics, purchase history, and interaction logs.
This CSV file contains the number of factors like sales, taxes on products.
Data Preparation:
Data Cleaning: In this process identified and addressed the column renaming and inconsistence in the data.
Feature Engineering: In this process changing the datatypes of the columns and creating the new columns. 
Analysis Techniques:

Predictive Modeling: Develop a predictive model for analyzing the behavior of the data for future sales.
Tools and Technology:
Programming Language: Python with libraries pandas, datetime and Scikit-learn.
Visualization Tools: For visualization tools used Matplotlib and seaborn.
Machine Learning: Sci-kit learn for implementing predictive model.
Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluated the performance of the predictive model using the Mean square error, absolute mean square error, and r2_score.
Communication and Reporting:
Visualization: Created visualizations and dashboards to communicate findings effectively.
Documentation: Documented the analysis process, methodologies, and findings in a comprehensive report or presentation.
